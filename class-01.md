> HTML Structure
 ```
 HTML Uses Elements Called Tags to Annotate Documents and Describe the Structure of Pages such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on ...
 Browsers do NOT display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page

**Some Example Of Tags**

* The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5
* The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
* The 'head' element, which contains the information about the document
* The 'body' element, which contains the real content of the document we see.

**Type of HTML Tags**

Html tags are categorized as Pair Tags and Non Pairs Tags on the basics of

- Pair Tags are tags with both opening and closing. 
They can have child tags and text. For exp `<p>` `<h1>` `<body>` 

- Non pair tags are tags with opening only `<img>` `<input>`

> HTML Extra Markup

**Block & Inline Tags**

* Block Tags
```
Block elements are the elements that always start with a new line, 
take up all available width of the website and are displayed in a column

```

* Inline Tags
```
HTML inline elements don't start with a new line. 
They also only take up as much space as their content

than just presentation For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph
