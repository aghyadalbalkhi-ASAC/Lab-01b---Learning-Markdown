Github Pages is a technology or we can say it's a tool provided by Github community to help the developer to make their 
code a life, as we know if you wanna test your code and host it or publish web pages to the internet  we need a hosting service which
it will cost some fees and it's not fair to pay every time when I want to view how my webpage looks like or when I want to share it with me, classmates.

```
Have you ever bought an electronic device and you didn't see the guideline book ?

everything you bought or you will buy must have a guideline that tells you how to use this device. 

it's the same in developers worlds *_* , every source code or project publish to the internet has a readme file
that includes the project explain and some instruction in how to use and install this code.

  it looks like a notepad file with but the difference is that we can make a readme file more structured and add 
  some markup to it acutely makeup (Girls Its a Joke ^-^)  .

with MarkDown we can
- mad a change to a text like make it **Bold**
- Adding a list item and links . 
- Add images
- making some headers.
